# Internship Package
---
This package includes my internship report, the CPA program I wrote for the FPGA board and the STM32 microcontroller. I also uploaded the power trace measuring program and the matlab program to transform the binary data into integer as a reference.    
Both of the CPA program use multiprocessing to handle the 256 key guesses for each byte, the number of processes is defined to be 8 in the program since my laptop can run maximum of 8 processes at the same time.   
##### Attack_STM.py uses hamming weight model
##### Attack_FPGA.py uses hamming distance model

This internship is a memorable experience for me. Thanks to Prof. Fei for giving me this great opportunity to learn this pioneering research direction, and thanks to Zhen and Cheng for teaching me all the essential materials.
